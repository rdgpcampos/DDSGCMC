application to segregation isotherm on defects in alloys, Physical Review E **104**, 025310 (2021)<br/>

The source codes used in this method can be accessed in the source directory, while the run scripts and all necessary files are <br/>
located in the ddsgcmc directory. Note that to run the NiCoCr example, first the NiCoCr.lammps.eam potential <br/>
needs to be included in the ./ddsgcmc directory (See the README file in the same directory).<br/>
