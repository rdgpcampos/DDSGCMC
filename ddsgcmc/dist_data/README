This directory contains the scripts used to build the energy databases from the energy data
of the energy change sampling simulation. A more detailed description of the database construction
process is given in [1]. The first step is to run the script sort_sample.sh, which collects 
energy data from ../energy_sampling/log.mc and sorts it according to the atom types being exchanged.
This generates the files sampleXtoY.dat, which contain the raw energy data for each type of exchange.
These files are then processed by mkdb.py using the following command:
    $python mkdb.py [n]
where n is the number of atom types in the energy sampling simulation. This will generate the
energy databases used in the DD-SGCMC method.
