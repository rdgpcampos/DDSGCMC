Example folder for DD-SGCMC calculation

Contents:
	
	inlammps_A.lmp & inlammps_B.lmp - LAMMPS input files for each replica

	log.mc - MC calculation output. Data is output here every 10 MC steps. Column values are defined as follows:
	(1) Current MC step
	(2) Energy of replica 1 before latest trial move
    (3) Energy of replica 2 before latest trial move
    (4) Energy of replica 1 after latest trial move
    (5) Energy of replica 2 after latest trial move
    (6) Energy difference at replica 1 due to trial move ( column 4 - column 2 )
    (7) Energy difference at replica 2 due to trial move ( column 4 - column 2 )
	(8) Number of rejections since last accepted trial move
    (9) Type of atom chosen from replica 1
	(10) Type of atom chosen from replica 2
    (11) Trial move flag:   1 - particle exchange between replicas
                            2 - particle exchange within replica 1
                            3 - particle exchange within replica 2

	stderr - output used for debugging
	stdout - output used for debugging

	dump - dump .cfg.gz files are written here

	log.lammps.0 - LAMMPS output file (replica 1)
	log.lammps.1 - LAMMPS output file (replica 2)

	mc.ctl - Definition of variables relevant to the MC calculation. These variables are defined as follows:
	(1) TEMP - Annealing temperature
	(2) C0 - Element concentration. For an n-nary system, only n-1 values need to be defined (concentration of first element is the complement)
	(3) NINI - Initial MC step (used when restarting simulation)
	(4) NITR - Maximum number of MC exchanges
	(5) NOUT - dump data is output every NOUT steps
	(6) LREJ - Number of maximum consecutive rejections before simulation is stopped
	(7) NELM - Number of elements in system
	(8) element X Y Z - X, Y, Z,... are element symbols
	(9) NDBS - Number of datapoints in each database must be less than NDBS

	NiCoCr_tiny.lmp - test atomic system

	run.sh - Run script.
