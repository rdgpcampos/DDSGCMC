Example folder for DD-SGCMC calculation

Contents:
	
	dErsv_XtoY.dat - Energy database containing energy change probability distribution for when an atom
	X is exchange for an atom Y in a large reservoir (replica). This data is divided into three columns,
	which contain respectively (1) the energy values with increments of 0.001 eV, (2) the probability of
	obtaining that particular energy value after an X->Y atomic exchange at the reservoir, and (3) the 
	cumulative value of the probability

	inlammps - LAMMPS input file

	log.mc - MC calculation output. Data is output here every 10 MC steps. Column values are defined as follows:
	(1) Current MC step
	(2) Current energy
	(3) Energy of the system obtained after the latest MC trial move
	(4) Energy difference due to trial move ( column 3 - column 2 )
	(5) Number of rejections since last accepted trial move
	(6) ID of exchanged atom (During MC calculation, atom IDs are not changed, only their "type" property)
	(7) Atom type before trial move
	(8) Atom type after trial move

	screen.0 - LAMMPS output file

	stderr - output used for debugging
	stdout - output used for debugging

	dump - dump .cfg.gz files are written here

	log.lammps.0 - LAMMPS output file

	mc.ctl - Definition of variables relevant to the MC calculation. These variables are defined as follows:
	(1) TEMP - Annealing temperature
	(2) C0 - Element concentration. For an n-nary system, only n-1 values need to be defined (concentration of first element is the complement)
	(3) NINI - Initial MC step (used when restarting a simulation)
	(4) NITR - Maximum number of MC exchanges
	(5) NOUT - dump data is output every NOUT steps
	(6) LREJ - Number of maximum consecutive rejections before simulation is stopped
	(7) NELM - Number of elements in system
	(8) element X Y Z - X, Y, Z,... are element symbols
	(9) NDBS - Number of datapoints in each database must be less than NDBS

	NiCoCr_tiny.lmp - test atomic system

	run.sh - Run script.
